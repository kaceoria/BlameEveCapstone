#Blame Eve Web App

###This is a web application designed for people with periods

Blame eve is designed to track your period, predict your next period, and add symptoms that you are experiencing. 
This was designed to look as neutral as possible, so anyone can feel comfortable using it. 

This is a beta app, improvements are inevitable! 

Look out for an interactive calendar, push notifications, profile editing, a social forum, and more!
